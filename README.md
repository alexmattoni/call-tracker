# call-tracker
 
call-tracker is a full-stack solution for scanning trunked radio networks.

It will use [trunk-recorder](https://github.com/robotastic/trunk-recorder) to actually scan and decode trunked radio systems, while call-tracker will sort, store, and serve a utilitarian interaface for playing back messages on specific talkgroups or frequencies, and even sort messages by radio ID when possible.
